tarpm

A command line tool to create and extract binary RPM files.  The RPM
header data is written to a JSON file.  You can edit the metadata
before repacking the tree in to a binary RPM.  Things like checksums
are recomputed as necessary so you can make changes to the RPM
payload.

The intent of this project is not to replace tools like rpmbuild, but
rather to add an additional tool for specific RPM moditification as
well as an alternative way to construct binary RPMs.


EXAMPLES
========


NAME
====

The tar(1) command is generally understood for creating archive files
of directory trees.  Tools like jar(1) are sort of a play on tar(1)
but for Java jar files.  Initially I thought of calling this program
rar(1) for "RPM archiver", but rar seems to be used elsewhere.  I
landed on "tarpm" because it describes the program, provides a short
command line tool name, and is sort of amusing.  Naming software
projects is the hardest part of any project.  Aside from testing and
documentation.
